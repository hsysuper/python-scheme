A Scheme Interpreter Written in Python with Turtle Graph Functionality

How To Start The Interpreter
============================

1. Install Python 3

2. Copy all files into the same folder

3. Run the command: python scheme.py

4. You will enter the scheme interpreter environment

How To Run A Scheme File
========================

1. Make sure you can run the interpreter properly

2. Run the file with command: python scheme.py <YOUR FILE>.scm

A Turtle Graph Example
======================

The file heart.scm includes a turtle graph instruction that can draw two
graphs at the same time by simulating two pens. This is achieved by log-
ging the route of the solo pen and retrieve the route back and forth very
fast so that it looks like two pens are drawing.

To see the drawing, run the file with command:

python scheme.py heart.scm

*The drawing may take a few minutes. To see the final graph, open heart.png
